review-data-structures-in-c-plus-plus
=====================================

This is some quick review code I've whipped up on working with classical data structures in C++ (LinkedList, Stacks, Queues trees )

To compile and test it (make sure gcc/g++ is installed)
g++ data_structures.cpp -o data_structures && ./data_structures 

a make file is in progress as is binary trees and potentially hashmaps
